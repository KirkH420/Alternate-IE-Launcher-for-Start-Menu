# Alternate-IE-Launcher-for-Start-Menu
Restores Internet Explorer to the Start Menu App List


This is a small project that I created to deal with an issue that I believe is caused by Windows
Update being designed in such a way that users can no longer exhibit any control over WAU. Because
of this, a user may one day realize that they no longer can use Windows Serach to locate
Internet Explorer. That's probably because it's gone!

Another strange phenomenon that will be noticable is that even after a user has restored IE, the
Windows Start Menu App list has some sort of script that will block Shortcuts (pointing to IE)
will become invisible. I say invisible because that's the best word. You can drop as many IE.ink
shortcuts into the Start Menu App list directory and they will not show up when you open start.

That is the main reason I made this.
Note: if you are missing interent exporer (because MS decided you don't need it) then you will
first need to fix this issue by going to Add/Remove programs and clicking "Add or Remove windows
features." Use the dialogue to uncheck Internet Explorer 11 and allow windows to complete.
You'll need to go back and do it again, put the check in the box and let windows complete.

Once you have internet explorer installed in it's normal location, you may use my little program
as a Launcher. You will create shortcuts to my launcher from now on and the launcher will open
internet explorer.

Note: This realy only matters if you WANT internet explorer in your Start App List.
The bug doesn't seem to affect pinning the app to the Tiles-area of the menu.
